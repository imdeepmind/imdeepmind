### Hi there 👋

A young enthusiastic professional with a strong interest in **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Research, Applied AI, and Software Engineering**. Also, can be described as a travel freak (exclusively on mountains) and an amateur photographer.

Currently a **Data Analyst/Software Engineer** at **TechVariable**. I have successfully completed over 5 projects so far working as in teams and also individually.

**Author of Deep Learning library NeuralPy**. NeuralPy is Keras like a Deep Learning library that works on top of PyTorch with 70+ stars on Github (Mid July). For more information visit [https://www.neuralpy.xyz/](https://www.neuralpy.xyz/).
